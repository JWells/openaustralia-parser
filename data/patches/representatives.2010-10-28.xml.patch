 <para>—I have been advised that Australia Post intends to close the Palm Beach Post Office as soon as 26 November this year. This will be a great loss to the residents and businesses of Palm Beach. My office and I have been inundated with comments from local residents and businesses on this issue in the four days since the announcement was made. These comments range from disappointment to absolute outrage. The people of Palm Beach are passionate about ensuring that their community’s current infrastructure is maintained and local businesses rely upon the services offered by the post office to conduct their business.</para>
